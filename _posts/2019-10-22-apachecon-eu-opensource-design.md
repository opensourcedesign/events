[ApacheCon EU](https://aceu19.apachecon.com/) is the Apache Software Foundation's European conference
about the latest innovations in containers, cloud, DevOps, IoT, servers, web frameworks, plus many other Apache projects and communities (including user-centred design!) in a collaborative, vendor-neutral environment.

This year for the first time, Apache Foundation has invited the Open Source Design collective to curate the first track about user-centred design.  

ApacheCon will take place between October 22nd and 24th, in the [Kulturbrauerei, Schönhauser Allee](LINK). The exact room will be confirmed in the coming months.

This will be a full day of talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects.

**We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.**

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, accessibility ... – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges.

Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Unique challenges that open source brings
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design/engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies
-

In the past we've had talks about [getting designers involved in open source](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_get_designers_involved/), [accessibility in open source](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_accessibility_in_os/), [application design and development](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_gnome_recipe_app/), [beyond logos](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_beyond_fancy_logo/), [architectural font digitisation and design](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_architectural_font_digitalisation/) and lots more.
