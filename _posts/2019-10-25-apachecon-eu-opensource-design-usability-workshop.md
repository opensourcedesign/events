This year for the first time, Apache Foundation has invited the Open Source Design collective to curate the first track about user-centred design.

As part of the user-centred design track we are running "Cheap, easy and illuminating – how to plan, run and analyse usability studies" workshop.

### Who is this workshop for?
This free, hands-on workshop will teach you how to plan, run, capture and analyse usabilty studies with software users. We have designed this session specifically for free and open source projects, and it is suitable for complete newbies: no experience on design research necessary.

### How many can attend?
The half-day workshop takes place at c-base from 10:00 to 14:00 and has a maximum capacity of 20 participants.

### What will you teach?
We will cover:

    - Planning usability studies: research questions, participant recruitment, protocol, technical set-up and research script
    - Running usability studies: how to moderate and document a usability testing session
    - Analysis: how to make sense of a usability study with affinity diagrams

You will create your own research plan using a software project of your choice as a case study.

We will run a usability testing session in the room that you will need to document as it happens. Finally, we will use that documentation to analyse the outcome of the usability testing session by building an affinity diagram.

#### What do I need to bring?
What you need to bring: you must arrive with a chosen software project as your case study and bring a pen.

### How do I register?
