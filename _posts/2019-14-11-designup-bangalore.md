A workshop organised by the team from Open Design + Ushahidi hosted and supported by DesignUP! conference. It will take place in Bangalore, India.

The ‘Open Design’ workshop which is testing a methodology, workshop structure, and repo/file set-up in order to see if we can boost design contributions to a specific open-source product. For the first two workshops, we’re using Ushahidi’s TenFour tool which is a crisis communication tool.

We’ll be looking at how designers can improve certain issues within the TenFour repo with the context being around the [Kerala floods](https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/for-second-year-in-a-row-kerala-floods-wreak-deadly-havoc-1.1565616937234).

If any OSD folks are around the area please let me know if you’d like to be part of the team in delivering the workshop and/or a participant.
